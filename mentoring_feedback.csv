,It seemed scheduling became a large issue. The issue got in the way of us being able to spend time mentoring. I would like to participate again but I would like to be paired with a group that pre-agree on a meeting time (e.g. noon EST on Fridays). I think we lost so much momentum in the initial months that we were never very cohesive.,,I think the groups are so small and that we need to match schedules before forming them. I like the idea of the program and want to keep contributing.
"Logistics of organizing a workshop, Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. install issues, answering learner questions), Developing confidence and skill in teaching, Preparing for teaching specific lessons",Meeting others who were at a similar stage,It was hard to find a convenient time. I think both the Mentors and Mentees expected the other to run/lead the content of the sessions so there was a lot of uncertainity during the sessions. ,"Give the mentors guidence on how to run the sessions, provide Mentees with guideness on what to expect either from the Mentor or the programme."

"Logistics of organizing a workshop, Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. install issues, answering learner questions), Contributing to curriculum development or lesson maintanence, Understanding the Carpentry community and culture, Navigating the Carpentries (communication channels)",I think we helped clarify why we teach some of the things we teach.,"As a mentor I sometimes found it frustrating when mentees seemed to be passive, not even wanting to suggest topics they wanted to cover. ",It would be nice if the expectations of the mentees could be clearly expressed.
Networking with the Carpentry community,It was nice to meet a few other folks in the community,"No one (myself included) seemed really invested in the group--at any one meeting, 2-3 people would just not show up, and the remaining folks were not very enthusiastic about the conversation.",Maybe have mentor groups with specific goals that mentees can choose to opt in to? Just something to increase the specificity/usefulness/engagement of groups.

Fortunately Jeremiah was able to pick up the slack. This is a great example of why having 2 leads is a good idea.,Maybe a central Etherpad or something so we could all read each other's meeting notes or some other way to be able to passively see what other groups are doing.
"Logistics of organizing a workshop, Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. install issues, answering learner questions), Developing confidence and skill in teaching, Preparing for teaching specific lessons",share experience on how to organize workshops and possibilities to get fundings.,Not enough interaction with the group; But it is entirely my fault! We were not located in the same geographical place so I found it very difficult to provide any meaningful help. This is something I did not anticipate... Now I know for next time!,"Better to include participants from the same geographical region; for instance for me, all the nordic countries (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland). I know this was something available already... I just did not realize how important it is!"
"Logistics of organizing a workshop, Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. install issues, answering learner questions), Contributing to curriculum development or lesson maintanence","Mentors learned something new from the mentees as well, met some new members of the community and got a bit more engaged, realised what issues new members of the community are facing which is sometimes easy to forget after being involved for a while - and this helped me when doing instructor training as well (e.g. not to assume that some things are public knowledge and that there is loads to learn about navigating the Carpentry community - and to point the new member to the correct resources where to find the necessary info)","Our group (tenon) only had 1 mentee and 2 mentors, so would have been nicer to have had more mentees involved as it would have helped with the flow of the meetings and conversations. Sometimes it felt a bit forced and we were reiterating the same things a bit sometimes (with the same person).","I like is how instructor discussion/business meetings are listed in the dedicated Etherpad, so people can come back and check on upcoming meetings. With mentoring programme, we had to arrange our own meeting platform (we used skype), and share our skype handles, etc. - and because our mentees were not very responsive it took a while. So I suppose, my suggestion would be to have a dedicated channel for meetings (Zoom or BlueJeans) and a single dedicated Etherpad where each group would list their meeting schedule (once they agree upon it) and potentially a link to meeting minutes Google Doc for each of their meetings - that way people as well as Carpentry admins would more easily follow what is happening in their own and other groups (for admins). And we could put example discussion topics at the top of the Etherpad as well, to remind people what to discuss."

"Logistics of organizing a workshop, Contributing to curriculum development or lesson maintanence","being able to pass along my experiences, pay forward what I was taught as a new instructor","Very difficult to get everyone together, and sometimes it felt like a meeting for the sake of a meeting",Perhaps a bit more guidance on what we should discuss?

Members of my groups were at all different stages (some not even though instructor training yet), so it was hard to have conversations that were relevant for everyone in the group."

It's tedious and makes the mentors seem like they are policing the process.
"Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. install issues, answering learner questions)",Having at least a small group of direct contacts,"The meetings were just the mentors talking to the camera and each other, sometimes just reading from the website. Then after two meetings we filled out another doodle and then there was never another meeting.","Have it focus more on intangibles like networking and contributing to lessons and community culture. Also maybe it's just me but I like ""guided lateral mentorship"" not ""top down"" mentorship."

"Developing confidence and skill in teaching, Understanding the Carpentry community and culture, Preparing for teaching specific lessons","chance to talk to someone with a lot of teaching and lesson development experience (stories about ""how things got to be the way they are now"" were esp. interesting)","after the first couple of google hangouts, nobody seemed willing to push very hard to make sure we met / did things.  we chatted on slack for a while, and several suggestions were made for ""what should we do next"", but at some point the baton dropped and nothing happened.","Maybe only one leader per group, so that it's clear who is carrying the baton?  Another idea: make it clear from the start that ""this group is for learning about and practicing lesson maintenance"" or ""this mentoring group is for extra skype practice with teaching (similar to the instructor checkout procedure)"". Then, have some ready plans for group activities (like ""this group will do two 3-hour lesson development hackathons within 3 months"").  That way, you're less likely to end up with all the mentees having different desires/needs (they know what they're signing up for)."

My group started a Slack group which worked well initially, but we but didn't all commit to scheduling regular meetings so it has languished a bit."

If there are types people could stay involved with mentoring by joining a different group in the next cycle.
