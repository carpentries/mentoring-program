# Mentoring Program 

Mentorship is an important part of SWC/DC. As instructors we both teach and mentor our learners.
We also mentor each other as instructors. We learn something new from each other every time we teach and
interact with one another. We may have been mentored when we started out as instructors and we mentor new
instructors who teach with us or other people within our communities. So far, this mentorship has largely
been informal, but we’d like to create an opportunity for our instructors to participate in a more formal SWC/DC Mentoring Program.  

This program will support instructors who are new to our community by matching them with a personal Mentor.
Mentors are experienced instructors who have volunteered their time to help new instructors gain the confidence,
technical skills, and teaching skills they need to successfully certify as an instructor and teach their first workshop.
Mentors will guide small groups (~4-5) of Mentees, holding meetings for their Mentees to do things like practice teaching,
ask questions about workshop logistics, and brush up on lesson content, depending on their needs and interests. Mentors will
serve as stable points of contact for Mentees from the time they finish instructor training until after their first workshop.
Mentees will have the opportunity to become Apprentice Mentors and eventually graduate into the Mentor role.  

## How the Program will Work  

Informational sessions will be held to introduce community members to the overall goals of the program and to solicit input 
from potential Mentees on the types of support that they would want out of this program. Both potential Mentors and potential 
Mentees will be invited to attend. (See outline of informational meeting below). Any instructor who has taught at least two workshops
will be able to serve as a Mentor. A Mentee can be anyone who has gone through instructor training, even if they have previously taught
a workshop or two. Potential participants will be contacted and asked about their interest in being involved with the program.  

After the informational meeting, participants will decide if they want to be involved with the program,
either as Mentors or Mentees. Mentors will go through a brief onboarding session which will cover the goals
of the program and offer suggestions for types of support activities that Mentors can offer.
Mentors will be encouraged to personalize the types of support they offer, but onboarding will prepare them to:  

- hold a practice teaching session,  
- answer questions about workshop logistics, and  
- help Mentees prepare to teach specific lesson content,  
- meet other needs identified by Mentees in the information sessions  

More information about these activities is covered in the Onboarding Process section of this proposal.  

After onboarding, Mentors and Mentees will be matched based on schedule availability and curricular interests/experience.
Local matches will be prioritized whenever possible to help facilitate the formation of local communities of practice.
All scheduling will be handled by the Mentoring Program coordinator (DC AD Erin Becker), to reduce workload for Mentors.
Erin will also serve as a central point of contact for all Mentors, providing logistical support (scheduling, help with technical issues,
etc) and onboarding new members.  

Mentors and Mentees will meet regularly (with a suggested frequency of once a month for six months) either virtually or in-person
for local groups. Together, mentoring group members will decide on the most productive activities for their time together.
These activities will likely focus on preparation for teaching Carpentry workshops, but may also include other career development
activities. Mentors can also help instructors who don’t currently have time to teach find other productive ways to be involved
in the Carpentry community.  

In addition to helping them prepare in general for certifying and teaching for the Carpentries, 
Mentors will also work closely with Mentees to schedule and prepare for their first workshop. This can include anything from helping
them coordinate with other local instructors to plan a self-organized workshop, to serving as a reference to help “sell” the
importance of this work to a Mentee’s advisor or supervisor.   

The Mentoring Program coordinator will stay in contact with Mentors to provide support and track Mentees’ progress.
She will record statistics on Mentee attendance and program completion and will collect feedback from Mentors and Mentees
for use on improving the program.

## Onboarding Process

### Part I: Information Session  

Potential Mentors and Mentees will attend a one hour information session to discuss the program,
the types of support that Mentees are looking for and that Mentors can provide, and to determine whether they are interested in 
participating. 

Agenda for information session:  
- Introductions  
- Outline need for program - >30% of instructors don't teach, here's what we know about why  
- Goals: Provide personalized support for new instructors to get them over hurdles to teaching, build local communities, 
give mentees career development opportunities  
- Possible activities: practice teaching sessions, Q&A sessions about specific lesson content, walkthrough on creating workshop website,
Q&A on workshop logistics  
- Importance of customizability of program - community input on other needs  
- New Mentees added as old Mentees graduate, or can choose to be part of program for only one set of Mentees  
- Time commitment - ~4 hours/month for 3-5 months (or longer if accepting new Mentees), this breaks down to about 2 hours prep,
1 hour meeting and 1 hour answering emails per month. Variable depending on meeting frequency and prep time.  
- Support that will be given to Mentors (via Erin)  
- Questions  
- Intention to be part of program  
- Next steps - submitting availability, adding to resources folder  
- Questions  

### Part II: Onboarding Meeting  
- Introductions
- Expectations of Mentors and Mentees
  - Mentors:
    - Decide on a meeting schedule with your Mentees.
    - Personalize meetings based on Mentee’s needs and desires.
    - Respond promptly to emails from your Mentees.
    - Follow up with Mentees who miss meetings.
    - Be respectful of Mentees. Provide a safe space for questions and mistakes.
    - Report Mentee attendance and progress to program coordinator. 
  - Mentees:
    - Communicate with your Mentor about your goals and needs.
    - Attend scheduled meetings and participate actively or let your Mentor know you won’t be attending.
    - Be respectful of other Mentees and Mentor. Provide a safe space for questions and mistakes.
- Overview of available resources.  
- Guidelines for running a practice teaching session    
- Guidelines for running a technology practice session  
- Discussion of other possible meeting topics  
- Questions  
- Next steps - introduction to Mentees  

## A Sample Mentoring Schedule - monthly one-hour group meetings  

This is provided as an example of the type of schedule a Mentor might set-up with their Mentees and is not meant to be prescriptive.
Each Mentor will set activities based on the needs of their individual Mentees. The Mentoring Program coordinator is happy to strategize
with individual Mentors about how best to help their Mentees, but each Mentor has autonomy in this area.  

Meeting 1 - Introductions and general conversation about mentees’ goals for the program*  
*The rest of the schedule would be determined based on mentees’ goals  
Meeting 2 - Walkthrough how to set up a workshop website, Q/A about workshop logistics  
Meeting 3 - Technology help session - R   
Meeting 4 - Technology help session - Shell  
Meeting 5 - Practice introducing yourself to your learners  
Meeting 6 - Practice teaching session (focus on confidence and answering learner questions)
