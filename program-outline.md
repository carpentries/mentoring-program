## Carpentries Mentoring Program Synopsis

The Carpentries want to offer opportunities to help community members learn and grow. Accordingly, mentoring is one professional development opportunity we offer our growing instructor pool. 
The Mentoring Program supports instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal. 
Mentors will guide small groups of no more than five mentees towards a particular outcome over an eight-week period. Outcomes might be anything from teaching a specific lesson (i.e. Version Control with Git) to making a meaningful contribution to one of our lessons.

## Carpentries Mentoring Program Highlights  

We are offering curriculum-specific mentoring this time around. Both mentors and mentees can choose which tools they are most interested in from the following list:
+ Git  
+ Shell  
+ Python  
+ R  

Once a topic has been picked, participants can choose the type of mentoring they want for their chosen tool:
+ Lesson Maintenance  
  - Contributing to current lesson development  
  - Contributing to lesson maintenance  
+ Teaching Workshops  
  - Developing confidence and skill in teaching  
  - Preparing to teach a specific lesson (i.e. Python)  

We will also offer mentoring that is more general in nature. For those who would like to develop greater skill in community building, either of these mentoring opportunities might suit:
+ Organizing Workshops   
  - Logistics of organizing a workshop (e.g. marketing, registration)  
  - Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. recruiting instructors, distributing tasks)  
+ Community Building  
  - Strategies to build local communities  
  - Tried-and-true events that help foster local communities  

Additional highlights include opportunities to participate in in-person mentoring groups. Both mentors and mentees will receive a certificate at the end of the program.

During the final week of the mentoring program, we will host a virtual mentoring program showcase. During this event, the community can hear about the projects on which the mentoring groups worked.
